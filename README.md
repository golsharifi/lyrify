# Caroke

Caroke is a lyrics app built specifically for a Car Android Head Unit in mind. The App uses the
Spotify API to get the currently playing track from your Spotify account and a 3rd party API
for the lyrics display. It also has easy-to-use playback and volume controls so that you won't have to
remove your eyes from the road.
